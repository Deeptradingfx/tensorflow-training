    "It is the convention in programming that the first thing you do is print \"Hello World\".\n",
    "So, like programming has Hello World, machine learning has MNIST.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is MNIST?\n",
    "MNIST is a standard dataset used for computer vision. It consists of images of handwritten digits like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1. Sample images from MNIST dataset (from [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners).](figures/MNIST.png)\n",
    "Along with the images are the labels for each of them, indicating which digit it is. For instance, the labels for the above images are 5, 0, 4, and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we are going to implement a simple model and train it to look at images, then predict what their labels are. However, take note that the model to be implemented here will not achieve state-of-the-art performance. We'll get to that later, at the next tutorial. For now, we shall be starting with a quite simple model called the ***Softmax Regression***.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall accomplish the following in this tutorial:\n",
    "* Learn about the MNIST data and softmax regression\n",
    "* Implement a model for recognizing MNIST digits, based on looking at every pixel of each image.\n",
    "* Use TensorFlow to train the model to recognize the handwritten digits by having it \"look\" at thousands of examples\n",
    "* Check the model's accuracy with the test data\n",
    "\n",
    "### The MNIST Data\n",
    "The MNIST data is hosted on [Yann LeCun's website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). We shall be loading the dataset using the following two lines of code:"
